# Botswana Housing Coperation App

This app was a hackathon requested by Botswana Innovation Hub, i was a developer in a group of for individuals.

I use React-Native as a cross-platform developmemnt library, Sanity to manage the backend since i had only 6 days to complete the app. React hook form to manage form validation, and aws amplify to manage authentication.
